                            <p class="mb-5 text-justify">To sustain the momentum of our country’s rice production, we must recognize the existing and emerging issues that hinder the progress of our agricultural sector. These challenges, along with our collective goal to ensure the affordability and accessibility of staple commodities, have driven this administration, through the Department of Agriculture, to devise integrated and comprehensive strategies that will aid our rice farmers in attaining higher yields and enabling our future generations to reap the gains of our endeavors.
                            </p>
                            <p class="mb-5 text-justify">In light of this, I proudly present the Philippine Rice Research lnstitute’s Strategic Plan 2023-2028, which aims to harness the transformative power of science and technology to reinforce the holistic development of our farmers, strengthen our rice value chain, and, ultimately, achieve food security across the country. Anchored on the Eight-Point Socioeconomic Agenda, it carries the research for development and extension (R4DE) programs which encompass three critical aspects that will give our workforce a competitive advantage, namely high-quality seeds, cutting-edge technologies, and agripreneurial interventions.

                            <p class="mb-5 text-justify">Considering the extensive scope of its programs, I trust that this will translate to increased rice production and employment opportunities for the millions of Filipinos who rely on this sector, as well as usher in a more resilient ecosystem that will benefit producers and consumers alike. Thus, I encourage all policymakers, stakeholders, and the public to help us in making great strides, for it will be the linchpin of our agricultural agenda’s success in the decades to follow. I am confident that, through our inclusive efforts, we will realize our agenda of making the Philippines a rice R4DE leader in Asia and the world.

              Executive Summary
            </div>
            <div class="content-section">
              <div class="highlight">
                <p>The government hopes that all Filipinos will have a comfortable and secure life. That is why it is our goal to protect the purchasing power of families through food security - the first among the eight-point economic agenda of President Ferdinand R. Marcos Jr. under the Philippine Development Plan 2023-2028.</p>
              </div>
              <p>To pursue this goal, the Institute endeavors to build back better by standing on the achievements gained and lessons learned from the past. Toward a vision of “Advanced science and technology for prosperous rice communities toward sufficient and affordable rice for all”, the Institute shall advance climate-smart, socially inclusive, demand-driven, and partnership-based R4DE.</p>
              <p>This Strategic Plan 2023-2028 is distinguished by its shift from a commodity-focused to a people-centric outlook. This shift is only logical given that rice farming is the major source of livelihood in the rural areas and more than two million Filipino families derive half of their household income from rice cultivation. In addition, millions of landless farm workers, and tens of thousands of merchants indirectly depend on rice for a living. Thus, this Plan recognizes that the prosperity of farmers and their communities is key to having sufficient and affordable rice for the country.</p>

              <p>Hence, aligned with and guided by the DA Strategic Agenda (2023-2028), Ambisyon Natin 2040, the National Agriculture and Fisheries Modernization and Industrialization Plan (NAFMIP) 2021-2030, and the Sustainable Development Goals, DA-PhilRice will implement three new flagship R4DE programs:</p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Rice Seeds Systems (RSS)</strong> involves improving and sustaining vigorous seed supply chains by developing innovative approaches toward seed security – from seed availability, access, and utilization to provide farmers with their preferred seeds that are high-quality;</li>
                <li><strong>Scaling Modern and Adaptive Rice Technologies for Prosperous Farming Communities (SMART Farm)</strong> focuses on innovating rice farming systems to help farmers boost their yield and income through the development of cutting-edge climate-resilient technologies in the whole value chain to increase the quantity and quality of rice which will ensure the availability and accessibility of nutritious, balanced, and safe rice and rice-based diets to all Filipinos at all times;</li>
                <li><strong>Rice Business Innovations System 2.0 (RiceBIS 2.0)</strong> encompasses improving the production to marketing of farmers’ groups with the goal of transforming rice-based farming communities into inclusive, competitive, and sustainable agro-entrepreneurs.</li>
              </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="content-section">
              <h3 class="section-header">Strategic Plan Anchors</h3>
              <p>The new Strategic Plan is also anchored on upscaling, digital transformation, and partnership. Upscaling is crucial since we want to ensure that our programs and technologies will result in adoption and significantly impact more communities nationwide. Digital transformation will integrate all our technologies into one system to prevent confusion and duplication, and make our platforms more efficient in answering the needs of our farmers. The Institute understands that it cannot deliver its desired impact by itself, hence it partners with farmers, SUCs, civil society, the private sector, and other stakeholders within the agriculture value chain to create a whole-of-nation approach to work strongly toward improving food production.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="content-section">
              <h3 class="section-header">Goals and Targets</h3>
              <p>Along with the Institute’s special programs on RCEF Seed and Extension and Malusog Rice, and the discipline- and area-based projects, these flagship programs aim to contribute to having:</p>
              <ol>
                <li>Prosperous and empowered rice communities,</li>
                <li>Nutrition-secured Filipinos, and</li>
                <li>A resilient and sustainable rice industry by the end of 2028.</li>
              </ol>
              <p>DA-PhilRice shall specifically work to help improve the productivity and income of rice farmers through the following:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Increasing yield by 4% to 6% per year;</li>
                <li>Reducing production cost by 38-45%;</li>
                <li>Minimizing postharvest losses to 12%;</li>
                <li>Diversifying sources of farm income leading to bigger income from other agriculture sources by 100%; and</li>
                <li>Engaging in value-adding activities and rice-based enterprises resulting in 50% increase in rice income.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>These are expected to help realize the goals of the DA Strategic Agenda (2023-2028), particularly the boosting of local production and raising the farmer’s and fisherfolk’s income (agenda 1); ensuring accessibility to affordable, safe, and nutritious food (agenda 2); developing strong, modernized, and climate-resilient value chains (agenda 3); and institutionalizing policy reforms and strengthening institutions (agenda 4).</p>

                    <p>Matatag, maginhawa, at panatag na buhay (firmly rooted, comfortable, and secure life) – this is the collective vision of the kind of life we want every Filipino to live (AmBisyon Natin 2040). Food security and poverty alleviation are among the primary components of this societal goal, where no Filipino is ever poor and hungry. While we have achieved great strides toward fulfilling these goals, our progress has encountered setbacks, particularly with the COVID-19 global pandemic. As our nation works to recover fast from the lingering scars of the plague, we need to consolidate and strengthen our food security efforts once again to get us back on track and seize the opportunity to build back better.</p>

                    <p>Rice – our staple food – remains at the front and center of our food security concerns. While the rice industry recorded high production in 2020 and 2021, perennial challenges continue to hound the industry players. A great number of rice farmers are still poor and afflicted with low productivity and high cost of production. War-caused disruptions in the global food supply chain exacerbate the situation by making agricultural inputs such as fertilizer and fuel more expensive.</p>

                    <p>Oftentimes, farmers have no other options but sell their fresh palay at low prices. Small farm sizes also impede many of the farmers’ scaling opportunities. Frequent natural calamities associated with changing climate increase their production risks and minimize their livelihood options. Weak institutions, such as fragmented agricultural extension systems and unclear roles among the national agencies and local government units, make it more difficult for farmers to access agriculture services.</p>

                    <p>As the country transitioned to a more liberal international trade, rice market players face stiff competition with better quality and cheaper imports, and sometimes smuggled rice. On the demand side, rising food prices bring down consumers’ purchasing power, eventually leading to lower food intake and higher malnutrition. If not addressed decisively, all these difficulties will derail the attainment of the eight-point economic agenda that the government has set to attain by 2028.</p>
                </div>
                    <p>No less than President Ferdinand R. Marcos, Jr. recognized the urgency of the matter when he declared that more than being a trade commodity or a source of livelihood, food is an existential and moral imperative on which the survival of any society depends. Noting the many things in the agriculture sector that would need immediate support, the President proposes a long-term solution to raise agricultural production by strengthening the value chain from farmers to consumers. He also acknowledged the role of research in the process.</p>
                
                    <p>As a relevant R&D institution, DA-PhilRice has been helping increase the productivity and income of farmers. In 2018-2022, the Institute bred 28 new rice varieties, developed integrated crop management decision support tools, and designed efficient farm machines. Along with our partners, we also secured the approval for the commercial propagation of Golden Rice, a new type of nutritious rice that contains beta-carotene. The Institute has also built the Philippine Rice Information System, which uses satellite imagery and other new digital technologies to generate information on planted rice areas, seasonality, and yield, and to predict crop risks.</p>
                
                    <p>Through its pivotal roles in implementing the Rice Competitiveness Enhancement Fund (RCEF) Seed and Rice Extension Services Programs, we also helped farmers gain greater access to high-quality seeds and learning materials resulting in yield improvement in target provinces. To increase farmers’ income through better market participation, we also engaged them in agribusiness through our Rice Business Innovations System (RiceBIS) program and “Sa Palay at Gulay may Ani, Hanapbuhay, Oportunidad at Nutrisyon” (PAG-AHON) project.</p>
                
                    <p>In the process, we understood that the pathway to achieving our desired impact is to implement client-centric strategies in our research for development and extension (R4DE) operations. This means that we will focus on our clients’ needs, preferences, and values to build a close and productive relationship (Figures 1 & 2). We also acknowledge that technology development is merely a means to an end; that for science to serve a bigger cause, its product must reach the end-users and serve their purpose. R4D is not enough – extension is a must to ensure that our stakeholders are reached through their preferred means of communication and interaction. We will leverage digital transformation to respond efficiently to both our internal and external stakeholders, improve our human resource productivity, and establish better data quality, accessibility, and security.</p>

                    <p>With this expanded paradigm of R4DE, while recognizing present conditions and building on the achievements gained and lessons learned from the immediate past, DA-PhilRice is now poised as presented in this new Strategic Plan 2023-2028.</p>

                    <h1>Overarching Policy Framework</h1>
                    <p>DA-PhilRice has been helping farmers grow rice since 1985. But our goal is beyond just feeding rice farmers; rather, it is to improve their income and well-being and help the consumers access affordable and healthy rice. These goals are anchored on several international and local frameworks to ensure our relevance and contribution to improving the lives of everyone.</p>
                    <p>The DA-PhilRice Strategic Plan 2023-2028 is aligned with the Philippine Development Plan 2023-2028 (Figure 3), particularly with the first of the eight-point economic agenda, which is “to protect the purchasing power of families by ensuring food security, reducing transport and logistics costs, and reducing energy costs.”</p>
                    <p>Our planning process was likewise guided by the following Sustainable Development Goals (SDG): 1) No poverty; 2) Zero hunger; 5) Gender equality; 10) Reduced inequalities; 12) Responsible consumption and production; and 13) Climate Action. The SDG, along with the gender and development mainstreaming efforts of the government, were carefully considered to examine conditions for disadvantaged groups at the nexus of gender inequality, poverty, and social justice.</p>
                    <p>We also ensure that our Plan would contribute toward the attainment of the goals of the National Agriculture and Fisheries Modernization and Industrialization Plan (NAFMIP) 2021-2030, the policy- and strategy-oriented directional plan that targets to guide agriculture and fisheries sector-wide growth. Specifically, NAFMIP will serve as our collective compass guiding us along three North Stars: (1) raising profitability and total incomes (doubling incomes of farmers); (2) promoting consumer health and nutrition via a balanced Filipino diet; and (3) ensuring sustainable rice farming.</p>

                    </div>
                    <hr>
                    <div class="content-text  text-justify">
                        <p>The vision of this Strategic Plan necessitates a shift from the commodity-focused to the people-centric outlook. It recognizes that the prosperity of farmers and their communities is key to having sufficient and affordable rice for the nation. Impoverished farming communities will never be able to produce sufficient rice for the country if they themselves are food-insecure. We cannot let them remain poor for the sake of having cheap but low-quality rice, something that consumers may not actually want. We must first lift our farmers and their communities out of poverty, so they become strong contributors to our society’s goals. Thus, we envision prosperous rice communities that are organized and engaged in self-sustaining agro-enterprises with profitable, demand-driven, and evolving business models.</p>
                        <p>Sufficient rice must also be affordable to consumers. Hence, we likewise want to empower consumers with sustained access to and informed choices for safe, healthy, and affordable rice. Expensive rice devastates the nutrition security of Filipinos, particularly among rural and urban poor who spend more than a quarter of their income on food. Yet, even those who have less in life would not just eat any kind of rice.</p>
                        <p>Many of them are willing to pay more to get good-quality rice. While changing times affect the preferences of Filipino consumers for their sources of carbohydrates, rice is a food that most of our households cannot do without. The key word is affordability or being reasonably priced, which gives a positive sense of bringing good value for money.</p>

                        <p>As DA-PhilRice navigates its direction in the next six years, we must be strategic on where we are contributing to the development of the rice industry. We must use our core competence in R4DE to advance science and technology for a greater cause. By doing so, we want to expand farmers’ access to technologies that are scalable, adaptive, resilience- enhancing, sustainable, and progressively addressing location- specific challenges in rice production.</p>
                        <p>We will also equip farmers with means to become productive, cost-efficient, and to create greater value for their product while catering and being attuned to consumer demands. We should help them gain practical skills and access best-fit technologies that will enable them to farm profitably in a sustainable manner. Our R4DE must benefit the people first before it can significantly impact our society as a whole.</p>

                    <p>To achieve our goals and targets, we will implement three flagship R4DE programs, namely: Rice Seeds Systems (RSS); Scaling Modern and Adaptive Rice Technologies for Prosperous Farming Communities (SMART Farm); and Rice Business Innovations System 2.0 (RiceBIS 2.0). We will also carry out special programs, such as the Rice Competitiveness Enhancement Fund (RCEF) Seed and Extension Programs and the Malusog Rice Program (Figure 5).</p>

                    <p>While projects under the flagship and special programs are designed to have an immediate effect on the outcomes, we will not stop creating new knowledge and technologies that will become new sources of growth in the future. This will be done through our discipline-anchored projects such as those in plant breeding and biotechnology, genetics resources, agronomy and plant physiology, crop protection, engineering and mechanization, rice chemistry and food science, socioeconomics, and information and communications technology. We will continue adapting these to location- specific environments through the efforts of our development communication, technology management and services, as well as our branch stations’ R4DE initiatives.</p>

                    <p>The Rice Seeds Systems Program targets improving and ensuring a sustainable and vigorous seed supply chain in the country, and ensures that high-quality seeds of the preferred rice varieties will be produced in sufficient quantities in a timely manner. The seed production components expected to deliver rice seed sufficiency are: inbred seed production and hybrid parentals/F1 seed multiplication; the resulting high-quality rice seeds are for distribution to and utilization by RCEF, NRP, and other rice stakeholders in the seed value chain. These two components shall be secured by robust and strengthened seed quality control, modernized seed purity analysis using high-throughput DNA fingerprinting, improved seed processing and storage conditions, and stricter crop health monitoring of all seed production areas within all our stations (Figure 6).</p>

                    <p>This is a new program that concentrates on innovating rice farming systems through the development of cutting-edge climate-resilient technologies in the whole value chain. These will address yield gaps, location-specific constraints, and data- use efficiency to maximize the quantity and quality of rice and, thus, ensure the availability and accessibility of nutritious, balanced, and safe rice and rice-based diets to all Filipinos at all times. It has two main components - the Integrated Crop Management (ICM) Project, which aims to create a package of technologies (POT) for transplanted and direct-seeded rice; and the Digital Transformation (Dx) Project aims to develop an integrated rice crop management platform and scaled up RiceLytics platform.</p>
                    <p>Program goal is to scale out modern, mechanized, precise, and best-fit mature production technologies for transplanted and direct-seeded rice through a leveled-up ICM such as the PalayCheck System that is also digitized. These ICMs will be deployed using the farm cluster approach, starting in all DA-PhilRice stations and then to RiceBIS communities in collaboration with local government units and relevant agencies to improve farmers’ productivity, make farming operations more efficient, and enable data-driven decision-making and governance (Figure 7).</p>

With an annual allocation of PhP 3 billion from 2019 to 2024, it is focused on the development, propagation, and promotion of inbred rice seeds and the organization of rice farmers into seed grower cooperatives and associations engaged in seed production and trade.</p>
                                <p>The Institute will also continue to co-implement the RCEF Rice Extension Services Program (RCEF RESP), shoulder-to-shoulder with the Agricultural Training Institute (ATI), Philippine Center for Postharvest Development and Mechanization (PHilMech), and Technical Education and Skills Development Authority (TESDA). With a PhP100 million annual budget, it aims to help teach farmers, farm intermediaries, and extension workers skills in rice production, modern rice farming techniques, seed production, farm mechanization, and knowledge/technology transfer.</p>
                                <p>The RCEF Seed and RESP converge with the RCEF Mechanization and Expanded Rice Credit Assistance (ERCA) programs to deliver its overarching goal to:</p>

            <div class="highlight">
                <p>
                    The amendment of the DA-PhilRice Charter and reconstitution of its Board of Trustees (BOT) are crucial steps to strengthen the institutional capacity of DA-PhilRice. These moves will enable the Institute to carry out its mandate and serve as the premier R4DE agency for food security and generate science-based innovations, helping surmount natural and man-made challenges to the country’s rice industry.
                </p>
                <p>
                    DA-PhilRice was created through Executive Order (EO) 1061 in November 1985. It steadfastly pursued its mission to help respond to the needs of Filipino rice farmers and consumers and the country’s efforts to attain food security. It generates and shares cutting-edge science innovations in various disciplines.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Even so, amidst a changing landscape and socio-economic context, formidable challenges continuously confront agriculture in general and the rice industry in particular. For one, climate change incessantly challenges productivity improvement in adverse environments such as rainfed, upland, saline, drought, and flood-prone areas. Increasing water scarcity, strong typhoons, frequent droughts, rising temperatures, new pests and diseases, shorter growing seasons, and degraded natural resources constantly threaten Filipino farmers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    These are further aggravated by socio-economic problems such as rising costs of farm inputs, labor scarcity, continuous reduction of per capita cultivated land, and more intense competition with international trade. The enactment of RA 11203 has also expanded the Institute’s mandate and area of operations, which required additional human resources with appropriate skills to deliver the expected seed-related services to farmers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Surmounting these gargantuan tasks requires the services of highly competent and multi-disciplinary teams of agricultural and social scientists, amply supported with facilities and funds and with efficient support staff and conducive working conditions. To pursue rice R4DE programs to improve productivity, DA-PhilRice needs a strong and full-force BOT and an updated charter.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Institute has long been operating with a less-than-ideal number of trustees. An amended charter would have enabled the Institute to better respond to the needs of Filipino rice farmers and consumers, and to the country’s efforts to attain food security.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There is an immediate need to strengthen the BOT and reconfigure the Institute’s powers and functions as stated in its present charter to further its purposes and objectives and make its processes and program implementation more efficient and cost-effective.

            <h2 class="display-7=8">Building Human Resource Capacity</h2>
            <div class="highlight">
                <p>
                    Over the decades, the excellence and prestige of DA-PhilRice as an R4DE organization can be attributed mainly to its pool of talented human resources. The government’s rationalization plan in 2013 left the Institute with fewer regular employees. At present, we have only 289 permanent and 43 contractual positions distributed among our eight stations all over the country. The plantilla personnel is backed up by over 1,000 service contractors, who comprise 80% of the Institute’s workforce. They do not have the security of tenure to motivate them to commit to our goals. To sum it up, the Institute has to compete with the industry in maintaining high-caliber talents and has to withstand the fast personnel turnover rate.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our human resource base is made up of our top management, the Board of Trustees (BOT), and the rest of the rank-and-file workers. The enormous volume of workload that is entrusted to DA-PhilRice, not to mention the boost in budget for our R4DE initiatives, requires a significant increase in the plantilla positions. This can effectively address new challenges and opportunities in the changing rice agriculture landscape. A strong core personnel complement and the corresponding support staff are commensurate to our accountability and the efficient use of government resources.

                <h1>Rethinking Physical and Digital Infrastructure Development</h1>
                
                <p>
                    The extent and quality of physical infrastructure are also crucial assets that would help bolster the efficiency and productivity of R4DE.
                </p>
                <p>
                    At present, the entire Institute covers a total of 581 hectares – utilized for office, facilities, grounds (18%); experimental area (14%); and seed production area (68%), owned and leased. Our physical assets have been growing, as evidenced by the P1.1B net book value of property, plant, and equipment, composed mainly of land, infrastructure, facilities, machinery, and equipment. DA-PhilRice intends to procure more high-end equipment and facilities that can cope with the operational requirements of rice research undertakings and the bulk administrative transactions; acquire at least 16 more service vehicles to be deployed to the branch stations; and construct necessary building structures.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With the continuous advancement in ICTs, we will also upgrade and update our digital infrastructure following the government’s MITHI (Medium-Term Information and Communications Technology Harmonization Initiative), which “harmonizes and ensures interoperability among ICT-related resources, programs, and projects.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    We will improve our digital infrastructure by setting up the DA- PhilRice Data Analytics Center, which will serve as the core rice data lake, warehousing modern data analytics, and allowing for a collaborative data science environment. The center hopes to reduce overall storage, maintenance, and operation cost on data, provide better backup, minimize the risk of data loss, increase security, and enhance compliance with regulatory and data privacy policies.

                <h2>Improving Administrative and Financial Systems</h2>
                <p>
                    The excecution of this Strategic Plan will require administrative and financial support systems and processes that are fully integrated, fast, and efficient, as well as accounting and auditing systems that are suitable for dynamic institutions. Leveraging digital transformation in its operations, DA-PhilRice shall work toward fully integrating its information systems on project monitoring, finance, procurement, human resource, and property management.
                </p>

                <br>
                <h2>Enhancing Corporate Income- Generating Capacity</h2>
                <p>
                    Higher seed classes (breeder, foundation, and registered seeds) are our main products. Our primary source of corporate income is the sales of registered seeds, which are used by seed grower cooperatives and associations to produce certified seeds that they sell to farmers. Hence, with the rise in demand for certified seeds under the RCEF Seed and National Rice Programs, there is also a corresponding increase in seed growers’ demand for registered seeds.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Institute will therefore develop and optimize the use of its seed production areas and further improve the production performance of its higher seed classes. To achieve this, we will start with the development of the acquired lands in DA-PhilRice Los Baños, Isabela, and Central Experiment Station (CES). Likewise, branch and satellite stations will analyze constraints to higher seed class production and devise operational strategies. Additionally, the Institute will upgrade and modernize its seed production facilities.
